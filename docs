Here I will document the way i am  trying to solve this project, as i will restart it and i don't wanna do it in a notebook bc i dont have a pen also im too lazy to go get one.


okay so in the main i check the args that send to the global that i am initializing.

i use mtx_global to make them start at  the same time

i dont think i need mttx for god

i use mtx print to print

i use mtx for death in the printf, in god and in the philos

also mtx for fullness but we'll see, i didnt hink of the code for that

i fill and checkk the aargs

then, i malloc for the philos, ii initiate them.

i made a ot of progress with help.. thank god and jaume
